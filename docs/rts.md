DataTorrent helps large enterprises to build, deploy, and operate fast data analytic applications. Companies need to gain insight and take action on events that impact their business at the speed of their business.  DataTorrent's Real-time Streaming (RTS) platform makes it easy to deliver fast data analytics applications that drive business outcomes using the latest innovation in data science and machine learning. It integrates best-of-breed open source technology innovation to provide all the features that a business needs to develop and deliver best-in-class, fast data applications.

RTS is a production-grade platform that is designed to ingest, transform, and analyze every type of data, as soon as it is generated, in real-time. RTS is set in an unique framework namely APOXI which binds applications and microservices allowing them to scale and act as one. It is powered by the open-source Apache Apex engine along with an easy-to-use management and monitoring UI, real-time dashboards, automated fault-tolerance, and real-time predictive models.
